# Wood Recipe

Adds a configurable recipe to craft wood from water.

Settings provided to control:

* Choose between crafting in an assembling machine or chemical plant
* The amount of wood produced per craft
* The amount of water required per craft
* The recipe crafting time

[Freight Forwarding](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FreightForwarding)'s landfill recipe requires wood, but does not provide a way to automate wood production (without using [Krastorio 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) or another compatible mod) by design -- not much landfill is needed and you can pick up landfill. However, I like to automate, so I made this mod.

Other mods for wood production exist, [Greenhouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/VanillaFocusedGreenhouse), [Just Another Greenhouse Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/just-another-greenhouse), [Simply Greenhouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/simply-greenhouse), [Bob's Greenhouse mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobgreenhouse), etc. These all add a dedicated wood production building, and some add more complex production chains. If you just want to craft wood without adding any additional assets, this mod is for you.
