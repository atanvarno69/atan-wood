# Wood Recipe

Adds a configurable recipe to craft wood from water.

Settings provided to control:

* Choose between crafting in an assembling machine or chemical plant
* The amount of wood produced per craft
* The amount of water required per craft
* The recipe crafting time

The recipe is unlocked by the technology that unlocks the selected crafting machine: Automation 2 for assembling machine 2, or Oil processing for chemical plant.

Productivity modules may be used with the wood recipe.

No additional assets or production chains are added.

## But why?

I was playing [Freight Forwarding](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FreightForwarding) and its landfill recipe requires wood. However, it does not provide a way to automate wood production (without using [Krastorio 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) or another compatible mod). This is by design as not much landfill is needed, you can pick up landfill and will incidentally pick up enough wood from clearing your starting island. Moreover, in Freight Forwarding you should probably be using waterfill instead.

However, I like to automate, so I made this mod.

## Alternatives

Other mods for wood production exist. Just a few good options are [Greenhouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/VanillaFocusedGreenhouse), [Just Another Greenhouse Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/just-another-greenhouse), [Simply Greenhouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/simply-greenhouse), [Bob's Greenhouse mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobgreenhouse).

These all add a dedicated wood production building, and some add more complex production chains. If you just want to craft wood without adding any additional assets, this mod is for you.

## Space Age Incompatibility

This mod is incompatibile with Space Age as it includes its own method for wood production.
